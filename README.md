# book-viewer

A React application that interacts with a 'Sherlock Holmes API'.
Core functionality:

1. Fetches a table of contents from the API when the application loads.

2. Displays the list of chapters from the table of contents.

3. Provides a convenient way for users to navigate the book by clicking on the title of a chapter.

4. When a chapter is selected, its content is fetched from the API.

5. The fetched chapter content is then presented to the user.

6. The user can easily switch between viewing the table of contents and reading a specific chapter with a convenient 'Return to Table of Contents' button within each chapter.
